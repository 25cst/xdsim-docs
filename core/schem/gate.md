# Gate

A **Gate** is a component that produces an output when provided with current inputs (e.g. an AND gate). It is allowed to have state which can be used and changed when calculating an output (e.g. a flip flop).

> [!NOTE]
> A **Gate** cannot be broken down into smaller gates, it is the most basic component.
